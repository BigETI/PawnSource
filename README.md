# PawnSource (The Russian Compiler)

## Description
This is a PAWN compiler used in the SA:MP community, which is called "the russian compiler".
The purpose of this repository is to create a carbon copy, what [justnonamenoname](https://github.com/justnonamenoname) has created in [this issue](https://github.com/Zeex/pawn/issues/147).
This is also a way to review the changes made to the original [Pawn compiler project](https://github.com/compuphase/pawn).
